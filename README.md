# Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (Stanford CS 224N)

- **HW1**: Word embedding (Word2Vec, GloVe) vs. co-occurrence matrix comparison, cosine similarity, bias addressing, dimensionality reduction

# C Practice

- This folder contains exercises sourced from the book "C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. My long-term goal is to delve into the workings of operating systems. Understanding C is a significant step towards this, as it's used in OS development for its performance and control over hardware.

# SQL Data Exploration in Jupyter Notebook

- **Languages**: MySQL, Python
- **Description**: 
    - Leveraged fundamental SQL tools, including JOIN operations, aggregations, and string functions, to analyze multiple datasets.
    - Employed Python for enhancing and automating SQL data retrieval.
