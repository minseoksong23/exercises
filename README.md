## Machine Learning and Large-Scale Data Analysis (UChicago CMSC 35025)

- **HW1**: K-means clustering, text analysis, regression
- **HW2**: Textual analysis (using TF-IDF weights), comparison between K-means and spectral clustering
- **HW3**: PCA, K-means, dimension reduction, Bernoulli mixtures on  neural data and handwritten digits
- **HW4**: Bernoulli mixture model, logistic regression, stochastic gradient descent.
- **HW5**: Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks using PyTorch on MNIST and CIFAR datasets, hyperparameter tuning, and performance analysis. (Basic architecture provided by the instructor.)
- **HW6**: Exploration and implementation of LSTM (Long Short Term Memory networks) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks), and a comparison between logistic regression and RNN. (Basic architecture provided by the instructor.)

## Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (Stanford CS 224N)

- **HW1**: Word embedding (Word2Vec, GloVe) vs. co-occurrence matrix comparison, cosine similarity, bias addressing, dimensionality reduction

## C by K & R

- This folder contains exercises sourced from the book "C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.
  
## SQL Data Exploration in Jupyter Notebook

- **Languages**: MySQL, Python
- **Description**: 
    - Leveraged fundamental SQL tools, including JOIN operations, aggregations, and string functions, to analyze multiple datasets.

## Stanford Convex Optimization 263A
This folder includes implementations of various optimization problems using CVX, alongside a comparison of different descent schemes developed from scratch. Additionally, I have implemented a basic linear programming solution from the ground up using the Newton method.
